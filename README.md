# meteor-mash
A python coded version of the old arcade Asteroids game. 
Created using the idea of Object-Oriented Programming, along with the usage of
mathematical, physical, and game-oriented concepts. 

# Default Settings for Development
- Python Version: 3.11.#

# Libraries/Packages Used For Meteor Mash
- pygame --version==2.6.1
- pygetwindow --version==0.0.9
- random --version==Default Version

# Reinforcement Learning
Implementing a Deep Q-Learning model to play Asteroids game.

# Library/Pacages Used For Deep Q-Learning
- numpy --version==1.23.5
- gym --version==0.26.2
- torch --version==2.6.0

        - Requirements for custom environment
        - Registering custom environment
        - Training an agent
        - Etc.

# Other Outside Sources
- Source: ChatGPT 
    - Used for debugging and checking code
    - Used to guide undocumented works with custom environments
        - Used ChatGPT to explain each step for future research and understanding
        - There is little implementation for a custom environment, I used ChatGPT 
        to help guide me through the process. Since this is my first Deep Learning
        project, I utilized ChatGPT for future references on how to set-up a custom
        environment to train on a Deep Q-Leanring model.
