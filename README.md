# meteor-mash
A python coded version of the old arcade Asteroids game. 
Created using the idea of Object-Oriented Programming, along with the usage of
mathematical, physical, and game-oriented concepts. 

# Libraries Used For Meteor Mash
- pygame
- pygetwindow
- random

# Reinforcement Learning
Implementing a Deep Q-Learning model to play Asteroids game.

# Library Used For Deep Q-Learning
- numpy
- gym
- torch

    - Contains other useful resources on the topics of:
        - Requirements for custom environment
        - Registering custom environment
        - Training an agent
        - Etc.

# Other Outside Sources
- Source: ChatGPT 
    - Used for debugging and checking code
    - Used to guide undocumented works with custom environments
        - Used ChatGPT to explain each step for future research and understanding
        - There is little implementation for a custom environment, I used ChatGPT 
        to help guide me through the process. Since this is my first Deep Learning
        project, I utilized ChatGPT for future references on how to set-up a custom
        environment to train on a Deep Q-Leanring model.
